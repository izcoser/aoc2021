Advent of Code is a yearly Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language. People use them as a speed contest, interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, or to challenge each other.

This repo contains my solutions for the [Advent of Code 2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021). :)
